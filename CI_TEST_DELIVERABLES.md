- **Test Dependencies**: Install pytest-cov and other dev dependencies
- **Environment Setup**: Configure local development environment

### üöÄ Next Steps for Full Validation
1. Install PostgreSQL and development libraries
2. Install development dependencies (`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`)
3. Configure test database
4. Run full test suite
5. Validate all consciousness-engineered features

## Consciousness System Validation Status

This deliverable demonstrates that the production repository has been established with:
- Comprehensive test suite structure
- Security validation capabilities
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Modular codebase architecture

The system shows clear paths for improvement and full functionality validation once development environment is properly configured.
